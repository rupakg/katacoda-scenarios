Let's first install the Serverless Framework. Click on the code block below to execute the command in your work environment.

`npm install serverless -g`{{execute}}

Now, let's check if Serverless was installed correctly.

`npm list -g | grep serverless`{{execute}}

Let's check the version of Serverless that was installed.

`serverless --version`{{execute}}

We can see that we have it installed.

Now, that we have the Serverless Framework installed, we can go ahead and create our first serverless application.
